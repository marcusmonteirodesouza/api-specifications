# Deep APIs

API specifications following the ["Deep Modules"](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs190-winter18/lecture.php?topic=modularDesign) idea by John Osterhout.

> Small interface, lots of functionaliy

Accordingly, the specifications in this repository should describe simple APIs that provide a lot functionality under it.
